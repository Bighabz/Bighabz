<h2>🧠 AI & Cybersecurity Internship</h2>
<p>
  I'm a cybersecurity student at <strong>California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB)</strong>,
  graduating in <strong>May 2026</strong>. I currently work as an AI research intern under
  <strong>Dr. Nestler</strong> on the <strong>AI Horizon Project</strong>, where I explore how
  generative AI and automation impact cybersecurity roles and workflows.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Built AI-powered classification pipelines to analyze "social proof" that AI is changing (or replacing)
    cybersecurity tasks across the Department of Defense Cyber Workforce Framework.
  </li>
  <li>
    Used tools like <strong>Notebook LM</strong> to generate an AI podcast describing my internship experience,
    summarizing research findings and explaining how AI is reshaping entry-level cyber work.
  </li>
  <li>
    Worked with AI agents, RAG pipelines, Supabase, and automation platforms to collect, label,
    and analyze real-world artifacts related to AI and cybersecurity.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can learn more about this experience in my
  <strong>2025 Internship Report</strong> (AI Horizon Project) and on the
